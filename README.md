# keyboard_analyzer

A simple keyboard analyzer tool to help me fine tune my keyboard layout.

Roadmap

- [ ] generating qmk combo suggestions
  - [ ] Bigram frequencies
  - [ ] Letter pair frequencies (not the same as bigrams, this analysis would combine each bigram with it's mirror eg. bl and lb)
  - [ ] group letter pair frequencies based on keyboard distance
    - [ ] parsing keyboard geometry files
